ðŸ“š Welcome to my portfolio showcasing my first course in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C#! ðŸŒŸ This course marks the beginning of my journey into the exciting world of OOP, where I have gained a strong foundation in essential concepts and practices.

ðŸ”‘ Throughout this course, I have immersed myself in the fundamental principles of OOP, including Inheritance, Encapsulation, Interfaces, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Exception Handling, Debugging Techniques, SOLID Principles, and Unit Testing. With hands-on exercises and real-world examples, I have developed a solid understanding of these concepts and their practical applications.

ðŸ’¡ As my first foray into OOP, this course has laid the groundwork for my future growth as a software developer. I am now equipped with the knowledge and skills to design structured and modular code, enabling me to create scalable and maintainable applications.

ðŸŒŸ Alongside the core concepts, I have also explored advanced topics such as Reflection and Attributes, which allow for dynamic analysis and modification of code, as well as Mocking and Test Driven Development (TDD), which ensures the reliability and quality of my codebase.

ðŸš€ This portfolio serves as a testament to my dedication and progress as I take my first steps towards mastering OOP using C#. Explore my projects to see how I have applied these newfound skills, building innovative and efficient solutions.

ðŸ’ª I am excited to continue my journey in OOP and further refine my expertise. Stay tuned for more exciting projects and learning experiences as I unlock the true potential of C# and OOP! Let's embark on this adventure together! ðŸš€
